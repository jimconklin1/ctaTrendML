These files are used to compute Equal-Risk Contribution (ERC) portfolio.

The only trick for the optimisation process is what fitness function to 
minimise. I followed Roncalli paper and as stated in the Wilmott forum, 
we should minimise the function defined by in the matlab script 
"fm_fitnessERC.m". 

I have also some Dow Jones data and a script file to test how the code 
is working.

Please note the parameters used within fmincon to let it converges.
(for fast execution, you can set the Display option to 'off' instead 
of 'iter' in qoptions. I set Display to 'iter' to show how the code 
is converging.)

The data in the file dowData.mat is the DJIA index and its stocks.
This is why I used only stocks to define the covariance matrix in the
file "fm_test_erc.m"

I used two functions from the finance toolbox to compute the
covariance matrix of the stocks (tick2ret.m & geom2arith). 
There are "a lot of" methods for how the extract the covariance matrix. 

The file dowData was extracted from an excel file, so you should find
the stock's names from the variable txt as "txt(2,end)". The dates are
"txt(:,1)".

Let me know if you are able to run the code. You should start testing
using Roncalli small matrices.

There is also a test script "fm_test_grc.m" for a generalised risk-based
optimisation where a specific risk-weights are assigned to a portfolio. 
In this test, we have RiskWeights = (40%, 30%, 10%, 20%).

Please let me know if something is missing.
